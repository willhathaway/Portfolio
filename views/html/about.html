            <p>Welcome to my portfolio site! Here you can find several projects I’m particularly proud of. I am
                currently
                enrolled in the Trilogy Coding Bootcamp at the Harvard Extension School, and will graduate in March
                2020. I
                worked at InResonance Software, a company headquartered near my home in the Pioneer Valley, between 2016
                and
                2017. After graduating high school, I attended Hampshire College for two semesters before taking a leave
                of
                absence to travel and learn. That process is ongoing, but currently has found
                me
                driving to and from Cambridge to complete the bootcamp. Some of the most fulfilling work I’ve done in my
                life has
                involved coding, from senior year of high school, when I used python to map kinematic equations for an honors Physics class, to my job at iR,
                to the
                work that I’ve done during the bootcamp (shown on the portfolio page).</p>

            <p>Other important areas of my life are running and visual art. I had my first show over the summer.</p>
